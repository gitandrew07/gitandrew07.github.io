                IGOR is by far, my favourite album by Tyler, The Creator, and also my fav album of all time <br>
                This is also the first album that got me into his music, from there it was like a new world <br>
                opened for me. I reccommend a listen to everyone, its full of different genres, not only rap. <br>
                My favourite track on there is "I THINK".
            </p>

                Tyler, The Creator's latest album is really touching, it was the first album rollout of his that <br>
                i have experienced, it was fun seeing all of the teasers and adverts around social media. <br>
                We could say this is a really personal album, talking about Tyler's insecuritites and other <br>
                topics. My favourite song from here is probably "I Hope You Find Your Way Home", literally brings <br>
                me to tears.

                This is my favourite Kendrick Album; personally, its really overhated, a lot of songs on here <br>
                are straight vibes. Of course it was something no one expected, a personal album from Kendrick <br>
                5 years after "DAMN.". Besides, i think this album is really touching to me, tracks like Mother I Sober, <br>
                and my favourite, "Mirror", literally would get me into tears.

            <p>
                Kendrick's latest album literally dropped without warning, 30 minutes after its teaser was posted. <br>
                It was something again that no one expected, this mixtape vibe really separates the album from its <br>
                past projects. The result is personally his hardest album to date. My favourite tracks are "hey now", <br>
                "peekaboo" and "gnx".
